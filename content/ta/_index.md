## Dr. Jessica Zeitz-Self
I was the lab aide for Dr. Zeitz' Computer Programming and Problem Solving (CPSC 220).

My role in this class was to help students during lab time and to create lecture notes based on the lectures given in class.

## Dr. Jennifer Polack

I've been the lab aide for two of Polack's classes so far: Introduction to Computer Science (CPSC 110) and Computer Programming and Problem Solving (CPSC 220).

My role involves helping students debug during the lab time. I also create lecture notes for students to look over while working on projects.

## Dr. Ron Zacharski

I was the lab aide for Zacharski's DATA 101 class. My role in his class mostly involved helping students debug during lab time and grading student's demonstrations of what they've done in a lab.

He also asked me to TA for the NVIDIA Computer Vision workshop that he was running at the University.
