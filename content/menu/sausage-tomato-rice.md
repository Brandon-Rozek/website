## Ingredients

- Olive oil
- Tomato can
- 2 little poblamo peppers
- 1 cup aborio rice
- 1 cup water
- Cumin
- Garlic powder
- Onion powder

## Recipe

1. Grease a skillet pan that's deep enough to hold the dish with olive oil.
2. In a blender, blend the tomato can and poblamo peppers until smooth.
3. Add the blend, water, and rice to the skillet.
4. Set the heat to high
5. In a different pan, cook the sausage
6. Once the rice skillet is boiling, set to medium heat.
7. Once the sausage is cooked and most of the liquid in the rice skillet is absorbed, add the sausage to the skillet.
8. Season to taste (will likely adjust this to earlier as I measure this out...)
