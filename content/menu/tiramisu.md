Surprisingly, tiramisu isn't that hard to make (if you pre-buy some things). I followed [this recipe from the NYT.](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018684-classic-tiramisu)

Total Time: 25 minutes + chill time

# Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups espresso or strong coffee
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- Pack of ladyfingers

#### Cream

- 4 egg yolks
- ½ cup sugar
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- 1 cup mascarpone (8 oz)



# Recipe

#### Making the cream

1. Whip egg yolks and 1/4 cup of sugar until pale yellow and tripled in volume.
   - A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl.
   - Move to another bowl.
2. Whip heavy cream and other 1/4 cup of sugar until soft-medium peaks
3. Add mascarpone and whip until soft, spreadable mixture.
4. Gently fold into the egg yolk bowl.

#### Build up the layers 

1. Dust bottom layer of an 8x8 dish with 1 tbsp cocoa powder.
2. Pour espresso into a shallow bowl.
3. Quickly dip each ladyfinger and create a layer in the dish.
4. Add half the cream as the next layer, then repeat.
5. Cover top layer with other tbsp of cocoa powder.
6. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in fridge for at least 4 hours.
