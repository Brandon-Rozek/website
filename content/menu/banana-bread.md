# Recipe

1. Adjust the oven rack to the lower third  position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Lowering the oven rack  prevents the top of your bread from browning too much, too soon. Grease a [metal 9×5-inch loaf pan](https://amzn.to/2YjmTAN) with non-stick spray. Set aside.
2. Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
3. Using a [handheld](https://amzn.to/3W5TmJc) or [stand mixer](https://amzn.to/3OMbx3g) fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and brown  sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.  With the mixer running on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time,  beating well after each addition. Then beat in the yogurt, mashed  bananas, and vanilla extract until combined.
4. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly  beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain. Do not over-mix. Fold in the nuts, if using.
5. Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 60–65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the  bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center  comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. This may be after  60–65 minutes depending on your oven, so begin checking every 5 minutes  around the 60-minute mark.
6. Remove bread from the oven and allow the  bread to cool in the pan set on a wire rack for 1 hour. Remove bread  from the pan and cool bread directly on the wire rack until ready to  slice and serve.
7. Cover and store banana bread at room  temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Banana  bread tastes best on day 2 after the flavors have settled together. See  post above for freezing instructions.



#### Notes

- **Banana Bread Muffins:** Use this banana bread recipe to make 2 dozen banana  bread muffins. Pour the batter into a lined or greased muffin pan and  bake for 5 minutes at 425°F (218°C); then, keeping the muffins in the  oven, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Bake for an  additional 16–17 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center  comes out clean. The total bake time for the banana bread muffins is  about 22–23 minutes.
