Hi there! I'm happy that you're thinking about reaching out! If you're at a loss of words to say, feel free to engage me on my [research](/research) or my [interests](/interests).

**The best way to get a hold of me is through email.** I advocate the use of [plaintext](https://useplaintext.email/). My email address is [brozek@brandonrozek.com](mailto:brozek@brandonrozek.com).

I support PGP encryption! My current fingerprint is:
```
1623 A4C6 0EF7 B422 D2C8 9D5D 0610 BBE9 9025 8018
```

You can query my keys through [WKD](https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD) ([Direct Link](/.well-known/openpgpkey/hu/o1dbwkdx683fduwgzmrbwa3yip41frdn)) and the [OpenPGP Keyserver](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=brozek%40brandonrozek.com) ([Direct Link](https://keys.openpgp.org/pks/lookup?op=get&options=mr&search=brozek@brandonrozek.com)).

```bash
gpg --auto-key-locate wkd --locate-keys brozek@brandonrozek.com
```

For convinience, here's a form that you can use to send an encrypted email. This happens completely locally on your machine with [OpenPGP.js](https://openpgpjs.org/)!

*Warning*: Some browsers have character limits in `mailto` links which can affect
the "Generate Email" button.
