**Professional:** I'm well into the PhD program at this point. I've been fortunate enough to receive the NDSEG fellowship which funds my work, as well as many wonderful collaborators.

This summer, I'm an applied scientist intern at Amazon Web Services. I work on the [Cedar project](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/) which is under Automated Reasoning in Identities. I'm especially excited at the oppurtunity to write Lean code.


**Personal Life:** For the internship, I moved out to San Jose, California. The biggest surprise to me is just how blue the sky is almost every day!

There's a lot to explore here. I'm making edits on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Brandon%20Rozek/) using the Street Complete application on Android along the way.
