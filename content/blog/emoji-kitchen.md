Clare mentioned to me today that Google keyboard has combination emojis. Intrigued, I checked it out. Not all emojis are supported, but a lot of the facial expression ones are. Select a supported emoji, and you'll be presented with different combination results.

Google calls this *Emoji Kitchen*. [Xavier Salazar](https://xsalazar.com/) created a [nice website to visualize all the combinations](https://emojikitchen.dev/).   These emojis are not part of any text encoding standard, but instead are image files. 

Now it's too hard for me to keep track of all these emojis. However, if there's one series that particularly resonates with me. I would say it's the turtle. Just look how awesome he is.
