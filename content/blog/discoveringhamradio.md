I feel like Ham Radio has been hiding in the background as I move through life. I knew someone that kept a Ham radio in his car, Noah talks about it frequently on his [podcast](http://www.asknoahshow.com/), and it seemed like the next step after [playing with](https://github.com/brandon-rozek/radiotuner)  [software defined radio](https://www.amazon.com/RTL-SDR-Blog-RTL2832U-Software-Telescopic/dp/B011HVUEME/ref=sr_1_3). 

One of the things that I think pushed me over to wanting to get my Technician's license is the discovery of [digital data modes](http://www.arrl.org/digital-data-modes). Hams even have their own [email](https://www.winlink.org/)!

Why is this more interesting than Internet? Well Ham Radio doesn't need any physical infrastructure setup (other than your radio and maybe some repeaters) to get you connected to other people. In fact, Hams often [volunteer](http://www.arrl.org/public-service) in natural disasters when the phone systems are down.

This convinced to buy a [study guide](https://www.amazon.com/ARRL-Radio-License-Manual-Spiral/dp/1625950829/ref=sr_1_6) and start preparing to take my technicians test this summer. If you're interested in Ham Radio, please contact me at my email on my home page :)
