Last weekend, on my way back north from visiting downtown, I took a break near the Crestview lightrail station. There, I had a wonderful meal at the [Kura revolving sushi bar](https://kurasushi.com/locations/austin-tx-airport-blvd/). Afterwards, I walked around the [Kinokuniya Bookstore](https://usa.kinokuniya.com/stores-kinokuniya-austin). Honestly, this spot is not something I would've naturally discovered on my own.

Using public transportation is a great way to explore the neighborhoods around you. Busses often don't take highways, and instead will take you through areas that you would've otherwise skipped. You can find many great restaurants to eat in the Bay Area right next to the Mountain View Caltrain station. A few years ago when Clare and I visited Portland, Maine, we got to explore the thousand islands by a [mail boat](https://www.cascobaylines.com/maine-boat-tours/specialty-cruises/mailboat/).

Even if you have a car, it's worth taking a look at the transit maps to see if there are any hidden gems.
