I don't write and send physical letters often, but if there is anything that would make me reconsider then it would the USPS forever stamps.

Forever stamps are first class one-ounce stamps. The price to ship these have gone up over time, but Forever stamps are always valid. The [USPS fact sheet](https://about.usps.com/news/fact-sheets/forever-stamp-facts.htm) shows that it started back in 2007.

One of the coolest things about Forever stamps is that their design isn't static. In fact, they release new designs often and multiple are usually for sale at a time. As of the time of writing, you can purchase them online at this [link](https://store.usps.com/store/results/forever/stamps/_/N-1uq0torZ9y93lv). 

The latest stamps to come out in recent months are:
