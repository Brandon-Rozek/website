One of the fun yearly traditions that Clare and I have is to go apple picking. After all, we live in a state that produces [a lot of apples](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=75112). Apple picking season always happen earlier than we expect, with peak season happening in September and October.

We went to [Windy Hill Orchard](https://www.windyhillorchardnye.com) and they have the following apples available: Cortland, Empire, Fuji, Gala, Golden Delicious, Janogold, Macoun, McIntosh, and Red Delicious.

From previous years, we decided that we like Empire apples and Fuji apples the best. We like to snack on the Empire apples, where we typically bake more with Fuji Apples.

Did you know that Apples are picked during peak season and preserved year-round to keep availability in grocery stores? In fact, only [5% of apples in the US are imported](PXL_20240922_164955826.jpg).

Unfortunately, we don't have the equipment at home to keep apples for the entire year. That doesn't stop us from collecting an entire bag of apples regardless and sticking it in the fridge.

Not all apples peak at the same time. Empire apples start peaking in September while Fuji apples start peaking in October. Since we went last week, this meant that sadly the Fuji apples weren't quite ripe yet.

Apple trees aren't particularly tall. There were plenty of apples within reaching distance. However, some came extra prepared  with long poles with baskets in the end called a *fruit picker*.

Leave it to humans, to come prepared with tools when hunting and gathering.
