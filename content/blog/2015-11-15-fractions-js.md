Last week I published my first library over on Github called [Fractions.js](https://github.com/brandonrozek/Fractions.js). Fractions.js is a library to help avoid the [mathmatetical errors](http://floating-point-gui.de/) in floating point arithmetic. What do you mean by floating point artihmetic errors? Here is an example: <code class="language-javascript">.1 * .2</code> outputs <code class="language-javascript">0.020000000000000004</code> even though the correct answer is <code class="language-javascript">.02</code>

## <a href="#purpose" name="purpose"></a>Purpose {#purpose}

My team and I are currently working on a new game for Math I/O. One of the levels is testing whether the player can add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions correctly. I didnâ€™t want to implement a solution where we check if the input entered is within a range of the answer. So I asked the team, how do you add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions in your head? As we were working through it together, I realized that this is a common problem over at Math I/O. So I decided to make a library dedicated to this.

## <a href="#how-it-works" name="how-it-works"></a>How it works {#how-it-works}

I broke up each fraction into two things, a numerator and a denominator. With these two numbers, I can figure out all of the most common operations.

### <a href="#addition" name="addition"></a>Addition {#addition}

For addition, if two fractions have the same denominator, then you just need to add the numerators.

    1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3


If not, then you need to change it to have a common denominator. We can do this by multiply each fractions numerator and denominator by the other fractions denominator.

    1/2 + 1/3 = (1 * 3)/ (2 * 3) + (1 * 2)/ (2 * 3) = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6


### <a href="#subtraction" name="subtraction"></a>Subtraction {#subtraction}

Works the same as addition, except the second fraction is subtracted (taken away) from the first.

### <a href="#multiplication" name="multiplication"></a>Multiplication {#multiplication}

To multiply two fractions, just multiply the numerators by each other, and the denominators by each other.

    2/3 * 1/2 = 2/6


### <a href="#division" name="division"></a>Division {#division}

Treated similar to multiplication since dividing a number is the same thing as multiplying by itâ€™s [reciprocal](https://www.mathsisfun.com/reciprocal.html).

    1 / (1 / 2) = 1 * 2 = 2


### <a href="#simplification" name="simplification"></a>Simplification {#simplification}

Sometimes with the operations above, itâ€™ll produce fractions in an unsimplified form. To avoid any confusion, I created a simplify function. It was challanging trying to figure out a way to code this. While I was browsing around for an implementation, I knocked into Eucliderâ€™s algorithm for finding the greatest common factor. Straight from the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) (where a is greater than b):


    function gcd(a, b)
        while b â‰  0
           t := b;
           b := a mod b;
           a := t;
        return a;


I can then simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by the greatest common factor.

## <a href="#the-api" name="the-api"></a>The API {#the-api}

I decided to provide as much flexibility as I can in the API. You have several ways to create a new Fraction.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var oneHalf = new Fraction(1,2);
var oneHalf = new Fraction(.5);
var oneHalf = new Fraction("1/2");
var oneHalf = new Fraction("1", "2")
</code></pre>

All of these results will return a Fraction with a numerator of <code class="language-javascript">1</code> and a denominator of <code class="language-javascript">2</code>. You also have two different ways to do the most common operations.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var fiveThirds = Fraction.add("1/3", "4/3");
var fiveThirds = new Fraction("1/3").add("4/3");
</code></pre>

The second style came from how jQuery implements itâ€™s library. That way you can chain operations.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
new Fraction("1/2").add("2/3").divide("5/6").subtract("7/8").multiply("6/5").toString()
</code></pre>

Outputs <code class="language-javascript">'63/100'</code> This is accomplished in the code through [prototypes](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/).

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
Fraction.add = function(frac1, frac2) {
    Fraction.correctArgumentLength(2, arguments.length);
    frac1 = Fraction.toFraction(frac1)
    frac2 = Fraction.toFraction(frac2)

    var newFrac = frac1;
    newFrac.numerator = frac1.numerator * frac2.denominator + frac1.denominator * frac2.numerator;
    newFrac.denominator = frac1.denominator * frac2.denominator;
    return Fraction.simplify(newFrac);
}
Fraction.prototype.add = function(frac) {
    Fraction.correctArgumentLength(1, arguments.length);
    return Fraction.change(this, Fraction.add(this, frac));
}
</code></pre>

In the code, the add prototype calls the Fraction.add function within it to avoid code duplication.

## <a href="#conclusion" name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion {#conclusion}

After I coded this up, I looked online for different implementations and found [fraction.js](https://github.com/ekg/fraction.js) by [Erik Garrison](http://hypervolu.me/~erik/). Itâ€™s important to look at different implementations and see which matches your needs better. This post isnâ€™t meant to go fully into detail of the library. To know what else the library can do, visit the [readme page](https://github.com/brandonrozek/Fractions.js/blob/master/README.md). If youâ€™re curious in how itâ€™s implemented, check out the [code](https://github.com/brandonrozek/Fractions.js/blob/master/Fraction.js).
