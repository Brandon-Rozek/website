Some time ago I came across a cinematic experience 

```

```

It was a Star Wars inspired animation, brought to you by Telnet!

```bash
telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl 23
```

*It's worth watching the entire thing.*

Fast forward a few years, and I've come across other great [telnet nuggets](https://www.telnet.org/htm/places.htm)

Remember that telnet communication is all over plaintext, so don't accidentally leak any secrets. Have fun discovering the quirky old world of Telnet!
