Traditionally I would hold one linux distribution per USB drive. Though with 32 GB USB Flash drives only costing $12, why hold only one per drive? That's where Ventoy comes in. With Ventoy, we can store multiple ISOs which it then presents as a boot screen. 

To install Ventoy onto a flash drive, follow the [Get Started](https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_start.html) guide on their website. Then once it's installed you should see a mountpoint labeled "Ventoy". There you can drop off any ISOs you want to appear on the boot screen. Here are some examples of what I keep in mine:



- Clonezilla
- Kali Linux
- Kubuntu
- Tails
- UBCD
