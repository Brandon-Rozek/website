I recently bought a [RTL-SDR Receiver](https://www.amazon.com/RTL-SDR-Blog-RTL2832U-Software-Telescopic/dp/B011HVUEME/ref=sr_1_3) off of Amazon to get started with [Software Defined Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio). To start off, I thought that it would be great if I can write a fm receiver.

To begin you will need to install `gnuradio` and follow the following [instructions](https://osmocom.org/projects/rtl-sdr/wiki/Rtl-sdr). 

## GNURadio





## QT





## Modifying GNURadio Python Script
