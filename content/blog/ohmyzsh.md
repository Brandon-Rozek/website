Zsh is an extension of the sh that contains a lot more features than the default bash shell installed on most systems. 

For example, one of my new favorite features is being able to type in part of a command in your history and using the up-arrow to find it.

For example:

```bash
vim test.hi
```

Then typing `vim` and up-arrow will expand it to `vim test.hi`. Super handy when you have to type of long commands frequently.

*Oh My Zsh* is a community project that superpowers zsh which allows you to easily add plugins and themes. The theme I'm currently using is [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#oh-my-zsh) which is a custom theme.

The list of plugins I have is:

- git
- colored-man-pages
- colorize
- command-not-found
- cp
- rsync
- screen
- ssh-agent
- web-search
- docker
