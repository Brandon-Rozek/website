It's summer and I'm currently in Austin, Texas, where the temperature ranges between 85 F when we had a recent thunderstorm to 100 F when there are no clouds in the sky.

I don't currently have a car so I rely on public transportation and walking to get around. As such, I'm consistently exposed to the heat. On the weekends, there is a strong temptation to hunker down and enjoy my air-conditioned apartment.  However, the part of me that loves going out and exploring wins in the end. 

As with any outdoor adventure, it's always important to be prepared. I don't leave my apartment without the following three items: bucket hat, sunglasses, and a water pack. Out of these, I would say the most important is drinking lots of water. It's the best way to [regulate body temperature](https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-weight-growth/water-healthy-drinks/index.html) after all. Also, it's better to start your day early, before the temperatures climb. Even after the sun goes down, it takes a while for the temperature to drop.

While browsing Reddit, I came across the phrase "Embrace the Heat." In my adventures, I see plenty of people eating outdoors, walking on trails, and paddle boarding on the Colorado river. It says a lot about human resiliency that we make the most out of any situation.

Yesterday, I rented a bicycle from Cap Metro and rode along Lady Bird lake for two hours. Before that I've been graced by the presence of the [Austin Troll Malin](https://peasepark.org/pease-park-troll), and I'm looking forward to kayaking at Barton Springs. 

If you happen to visit Austin and want an indoor activity, I recommend visiting the [state capitol](https://tspb.texas.gov/plan/tours/tours.html). They allow visitors to sit in the gallerie and observe when the state house and senate is in session which is pretty cool to witness. 

Otherwise, embrace the heat. Wear light clothes and come prepared to sweat.
