As time goes on more and more scripts start to accumulate in my scripts folder. It turns out though, that there is a standard way of having local user scripts that get automatically added to your path. I started noticing this in Ubuntu when more and more projects started utilizing the `~/.local/bin` directory. 

So stick any scripts you have in there since by default on some distributions `$PATH` is setup to look there!
