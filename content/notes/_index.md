## Small Group Study
Chris Richters, Ethan Martin, and I embarked on the book ["Algorithms" by Jeff Erickson](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/). I took some notes during our discussions but you should really just read the book instead. [Notes Page](algorithms)

Carlos Ramirez, Ethan Martin, and I started on the book "Elements of Radio" by Abraham and William Marcus. It provides a great introduction to radio not assuming an engineering background.

## Courses

Below are the courses that I have documents up online for.

[Probability and Statistical Inference I](stat381)

[Real Analysis Quick Facts](realanalysis)

[Some Abstract 2 Definitions](abstract2def)
