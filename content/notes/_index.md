Notes for several study groups and courses that I've taken. Likely
not helpful for the average person, but I keep it up here for archival
purposes.

## Small Study Groups
- Chris Richters, Ethan Martin, and I embarked on the book ["Algorithms" by Jeff Erickson](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/). I took some notes during our discussions but you should really just read the book instead. [Notes Page](algorithms)
- Carlos Ramirez, Ethan Martin, and I started on the book "Elements of Radio" by Abraham and William Marcus. It provides a great introduction to radio not assuming an engineering background.
- [Notes on Dimensionality Reduction](dimensionalityreduction)

## Courses
- [Probability and Statistical Inference I](stat381)
- [Real Analysis Quick Facts](realanalysis)
- [Some Abstract 2 Definitions](abstract2def)
- [Handy Facts about Quadratic Congruences](quadraticcongruences)
- [Bayesian Statistics](bayesianstatistics)
- [Reproducible Research](reproducibleresearch)
