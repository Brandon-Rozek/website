# Algorithms Book Study
A couple of my friends and I decided to start a book club following "Algorithms" by Jeff Erickson. One bonus is that he gives it away for free on [his website](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/)!

Of course you should totally check his book out rather than reading my notes. There are tons of witty and fun things in his textbook, not a dry reading I promise. These notes are here mostly for archival purposes.

## Notes
[Chapter 1](recursion)

[Chapter 2](backtracking)

[Chapter 3](dynamic)

[Chapter 4](greedy)
