# Voronoi Diagram

A Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plan into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane.

The set of points (often called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than any other.

Different metrics may be used and often result in different Voronoi diagrams
