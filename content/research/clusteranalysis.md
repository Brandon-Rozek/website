Title: Cluster Analysis
Description: A study of grouping observations
---

Cluster Analysis is the art of finding inherent structures in data to form groups of similar observations. This has a myriad of applications from recommendation engines to social network analysis.

This is an independent study, meaning that I will be studying this topic under the direction of a professor, in this case being Dr. Denhere.

I have provided a list of topics that I wish to explore in a [syllabus](syllabus)

Dr. Denhere likes to approach independent studies from a theoretical and applied sense. Meaning, I will learn the theory of the different algorithms, and then figure out a way to apply them onto a dataset.

## Readings
There is no definitive textbook for this course. Instead I and Dr. Denhere search for materials that we think best demonstrates the topic at hand. 

I have created a [Reading Page](readings) to keep track of the different reading materials.


## Learning Notes
I like to type of the content I learn from different sources. A [notes page](notes) is created to keep track of the content discussed each meeting.
