LUNA-C stands for Large Universal Network Array of Computers and it was a project started back in August 2017 to introduce a cluster computing system to the University. I started this project in response to a want for more computing power to help with the Physics research I was doing at the time.
Dr. Maia Magrakvalidze was the faculty sponsor for this project.

One of the Physics labs at the time were getting their computers upgraded
and the old computers were going to be surplussed. I along with Carlos
Ramirez and Clare Arrington convinced them to let us use the surplussed
computers for a Beowulf cluster. We wrote a grant proposal to acquire
hardware upgrades (RAM, SSDs, etc.) for the computers. Later on,
Stefano Cornonado joined the project.
