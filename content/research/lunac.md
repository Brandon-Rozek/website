# LUNA-C

LUNA-C stands for Large Universal Network Array of Computers and it was a project started back in August 2017 to introduce a cluster computing system to the University. I started this project in response to a want for more computing power to help with the Physics research I was doing at the time.

I started this project and wrote a grant proposal and have brought on many students to help make this dream come true. The resources below give a look into all the thoughts and ideas that went along with the project.
