Back in the Fall of 2018, under the guidance of Ian Finlayson, I worked towards creating a programming language similar to SLOTH (Simple Language of Tiny Heft). The language as of now is interpreted and supports array based programming.

Before this study, I worked though a book called ["Build your own Lisp"](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) and my implementation of a lisp like language: [Lispy Code](https://github.com/brandon-rozek/lispy)
