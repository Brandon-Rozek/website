## CryptoSolve: Towards a Tool for the Symbolic Analysis of Cryptographic Algorithms

On April 3rd 2022, I presented a paper at the 14th International Workshop on Rewriting Logic and its Applications (WRLA 2022). This presentation features
[CryptoSolve](https://symcollab.github.io/CryptoSolve/) a tool that generates and verifies Cryptographic Modes of Operations.

## Expedited Learning via Interactive Demonstrations

On December 4, 2019, I gave a defense on my honors research in the incorporation of demonstration data throughout a reinforcement learning algorithm. I have shown that this technique expedites the learning process.

## Embezzlement of Parking Meter Funds: A Computational Approach to Hypothesis Testing

I was invited to give a talk to the Data Science Group at the University of Mary Washington called the Data Mavens. It was a 25 minute presentation on the bootstrap resampling technique with code on how to get started.

## Similyrics: A Music Recommendation Engine Based on Lyrics
At the VCU RamHacks hackathon, Clare Arrington, Harrison Crosse, and I demoed our product Similyrics. It's a web application that takes your favorite song, grabs the lyrics, and finds a song from a database that closely matches to the song you have chosen lyric wise.
