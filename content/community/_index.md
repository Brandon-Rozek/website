## Logic Reading Group
I co-founded the NY Captital Region Logic Reading Group.
The idea here is to present papers within automated reasoning,
logic-based artificial intelligence, and normative ethics.

## ./UMWLUG
I was the co-founder and vice president of UMW's Linux Users Group. I mainly brought interesting people to come and talk about Linux and open source.

## Cybersecurity - Capture the Flag
Capture the Flag (CTF) is a competition in where teams try to find *flags* by doing different types of cybersecurity type problems. This can include using the wayback machine, breaking a simple cryptosystem, as well as finding exploits in a sandboxed system. 

I was part of a committee of four people making problems for UMW's first CTF competition.

If you're interested in this sort of thing and just starting out, one website that I found which is really cool is called [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

## Datakind

In the summer of 2018, I attended the month Datakind events in DC. In it, I mostly performed data cleaning and verification for non-profit organizations in the area.
