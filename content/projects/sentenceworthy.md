### [Sentence Worthy](http://sentenceworthy.com) {.project-title}

Sentence Worthy is a side project created by [Tori Dayton](http://toridayton.com) and I. We combine both of our passions, writing and photography, and make something for others to enjoy. Have a look at our [creation](http://sentenceworthy.com).

I am the main developer and photographer of this site. I head out every so often and take pictures of whatever interests me. Then, I email Tori my choice picks and she tells me what she wants to do with the pictures and what ideas she has for them. I then edit the picture with her ideas in mind. After we go back and forth on the picture edits, Tori sends me a one sentence story she made that goes along with the picture. The picture and story then get published together onto the website. Hence the tagline, every picture is worth a sentence.
