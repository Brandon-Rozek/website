### [Math I/O](http://math-io.com)

Math I/O is a website I founded with [David Thames](http://davidcthames.com) and Stephen Shamaiengar. The goal of this website is to help reinforce high school level math concepts in the form of enjoyable games. Most of the games are made using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript. You can check them out [here](http://math-io.com/).

I ran Math I/O for a year until I moved away from the area. During that year, I worked on the Darts game, Speed Transformations, and Theta. I then took about a year off to get adjusted to my new place when I moved.

While I was away, Math I/O gained many new people, making it hard for them to work as one large group. David then decided to split the group up into smaller teams, inviting me to come back and lead one. I never ran a team remotely before, so I was excited to see how it would be like.

The team I lead are mostly full of people starting out in programming. To help them out, I started giving lectures once a week to introduce concepts, and posted them here on my writings page. We would then practice these concepts while making a new game during the meetings. I couldn't ask for a better team, their enthusiasm drives me to keep working at Math I/O.
