### [Tori Dayton](http://toridayton.com) {.project-title}

Tori Dayton is a great friend and poet, this is the site I made for her to showcase her writings. It&#8217;s the first WordPress project I worked on and it set the tone for all the future ones I did. Check out her [writings!](http://toridayton.com/work) I&#8217;m a fan of her work. (Not biased at all)

Fun Fact: I also worked on the [Tori Bot](http://toridayton.com/category/tori-bot/) on the site. Tori Bot takes existing poems and tries to generate a new one using the [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/) library made for Python.
