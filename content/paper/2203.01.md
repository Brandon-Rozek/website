abstract: "We present a new tool for the automatic synthesis and verifi-
cation of cryptographic algorithms. Currently the tool considers symbolic
security and invertibility of recursively defined modes of operation with
an xor-operation and encryption. A cryptographic mode of operation is
an algorithm for encrypting a message of arbitrary length using a block
cipher that only encrypts messages of a single fixed length. The system
can both automatically generate modes and accept user-defined ones.
These modes can then be checked for properties such as security and
invertibility. In order to analyze the modes, the tool utilizes term rewrit-
ing and unification methods which are implemented in a core supporting
library. The state of the tool and underlying library are in an initial iter-
ation. The goal is to continue expanding the tool to consider additional
security questions and cryptosystems."
