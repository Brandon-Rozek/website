abstract: "We present our work on a new modal logic of optimality, OPT, whose semantics are modeled in terms of optimal paths through reward-weighted transition systems. We prove some basic properties of OPT, including its status as a normal modal logic, as well as its relation to some of the standard modal axioms. We end with a discussion of applications to AI and future research directions and extensions."
