abstract: "We introduce VSPursuer, an automated reasoning tool that analyses matrices generated by Slaney’s MaGIC. The tool searches these matrices for a target logic to find one that witnesses the logic’s satisfaction of the Variable Sharing Property. We describe the theoretical background behind VSPursuer and highlight optimisations that enable our tool to determine whether a given matrix witnesses the property in polynomial time. We then give some example data sets for particular relevant logics, a theoretical analysis on the sizes of matrices generated by MaGIC which do not witness variable sharing, and close with an appendix explaining how to install and use VSPursuer."
