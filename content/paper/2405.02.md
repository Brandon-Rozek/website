abstract: "We introduce the C0 family of logics, which include temporalized modal operators for belief and hyperintensional modal operators for obligations and goals. We motivate the C0 family as extended doxastic fragments of the DCEC family of logics, which are cognitive calculi designed for theory-of-mind reasoning among multiple artificial agents. In the literature, DCEC family logics are defined exclusively using proof-theoretic semantics. In this work we provide a model theory for the C0 family of logics which constitutes the first steps towards providing a model theory for the DCEC cognitive calculi family as a whole. We investigate the fragment relationships between both the C0 family and the DCEC family, produce a model theory for the C0 family and prove important results establishing completeness for all C0 family logics and establish soundness for C0 fragments without time."
