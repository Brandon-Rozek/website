abstract: "Recently, interest has been emerging in the application of symbolic techniques to the specification and analysis of cryptosystems. These techniques, when accompanied by suitable proofs of soundness/completeness, can be used both to identify insecure cryptosystems and prove sound ones secure. But although a number of such symbolic algorithms have been developed and implemented, they remain scattered throughout the literature. In this paper, we present a tool, CryptoSolve, which provides a common basis for specification and implementation of these algorithms, CryptoSolve includes libraries that provide the term algebras used to express symbolic cryptographic systems, as well as implementations of useful algorithms, such as unification and variant generation. In its current initial iteration, it features several algorithms for the generation and analysis of cryptographic modes of operation, which allow one to use block ciphers to encrypt messages more than one block long. The goal of our work is to continue expanding the tool in order to consider additional cryptosystems and security questions, as well as extend the symbolic libraries to increase their applicability."
